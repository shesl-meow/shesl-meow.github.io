The use of Linux containers to deploy applications is called containerization.
Containerization is increasingly popular because containers are:
Flexible, Lightweight, Interchangeable, Portable, Scalable, Stackable Images and Containers # Image：包含所有运行一个程序所需环境的可执行包。比如：其中的代码，库文件，环境变量，配置文件等等。一个 container 通过运行一个 image 启动。</description></item><item><title/><link>http://shesl-meow.github.io/docs/%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/docker/2.containers/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://shesl-meow.github.io/docs/%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/docker/2.containers/</guid><description>Part 2: Containers # We start at the bottom of the hierarchy of such an app, which is a container, which we cover on this page.
新的开发环境 Container # In the past, if you were to start writing a Python app, your first order of business was to install a Python runtime onto your machine. But, that creates a situation where the environment on your machine needs to be perfect for your app to run as expected, and also needs to match your production environment.</description></item><item><title/><link>http://shesl-meow.github.io/docs/%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/docker/3.services/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://shesl-meow.github.io/docs/%E5%B7%A5%E5%85%B7%E4%BD%BF%E7%94%A8%E6%8E%A5%E5%8F%A3/docker/3.services/</guid><description>Part 3: Services # 关于 Services # In a distributed application, different pieces of the app are called “services”. For example, if you imagine a video sharing site, it probably includes a service for storing application data in a database, a service for video transcoding in the background after a user uploads something, a service for the front-end, and so on.
Services are really just “containers in production.” A service only runs one image, but it codifies the way that image runs—what ports it should use, how many replicas of the container should run so the service has the capacity it needs, and so on.</description></item></channel></rss>
